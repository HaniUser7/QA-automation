Since a reference letter is a formal document, you need to be sure that what you include in it isn’t a lie or an alteration of the truth since this may attract legal penalties. There are some qualities and rules that you must possess or stick to, respectively before proceeding to write a reference letter. These crucial itThe person you are writing about should be someone that you know very well either from a personal experience as is the case for a letter of reference for a friend, or from the existing records in your school or institution. A good example of a person who can’t write a reliable reference letter is a lecturer who writes a reference letter for student who barely attends his/her lecturers.You should know the person in question in a capacity which gives you a suitable ability to draft a meaningful reference letter. This can be the case for someone who has worked with the candidate in question for a long time as they would have some reliable and meaningful information about the subject in question that the prospective employer can rely on.You should be in a position of providing an honest and yet positive reference letter. The rule is if you have nothing good to say don’t write a reference letter. In case you rubbed shoulders or have some personal feuds with the subject in question it is best to decline writing a reference letter about them. You can advise them to ask someone else to write the reference letter instead Save Changes"
